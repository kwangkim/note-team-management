How to setup my sql at c9
https://c9.io/site/blog/2013/05/mysql-for-every-workspace/

terminal.

# start MySQL. Will create an empty database on first start
        $ mysql-ctl start
        
        # stop MySQL
        $ mysql-ctl stop
        
        # run the MySQL interactive shell
        $ mysql-ctl cli
You can then connect to the database with following parameters:

Option	Value	Comment
Hostname	$IP	The same local IP as the application you run on Cloud9
Port	3306	The default MySQL port number
User	$C9_USER	Your Cloud9 user name
Password	-	No password since you can only access the DB from within the workspace
Database	c9	The database name
Of course this is just the beginning. We have for example plans to add a management UI to start and stop databases or pre-installing tools like phpMyAdmin. However we donâ€™t want to make you wait for the fully integrated feature while we already have something that is enabling a lot of use cases and still super easy to use.
